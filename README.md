Cricket Scorecard Management System
                                                                                                                                          
Overview
The Cricket Scorecard Management System is a C++ program designed to manage and display detailed cricket match data using OOPs and file handling. This project eliminates the need for a graphical interface, focusing on efficient storage and output through text files.

Features
Ball-by-Ball Updates : Tracks every ball of the match for both innings.
File Handling        : Stores match details, scorecards, and final results in structured text files.
Comprehensive Output : Generates detailed scorecards and match summaries.
User-Friendly        : Provides an easy-to-read text-based scorecard for quick reference.

How It Works
Input cricket match details like teams, players, and overs through the program.
The system processes each ball, updating the scorecard and match summary.
All data is stored in text files for future reference and analysis.

File Structure
input.txt: Contains the input details for the match (e.g., teams, players, overs).
output.txt: Outputs the scorecard and match summary.
samplerun/: Folder containing example input and output files for sample matches.

Prerequisites
C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Visual Studio)

How to Run
Clone this repository to your local system.
Compile the src.cpp file using your preferred C++ compiler.
Run the program, and follow the prompts to input match details.
